#  AI Roadmap ‚Üí BPMN Workflow Converter

Convert product or project roadmaps into clean, visual **BPMN workflows** using AI.  
Built with **Java + React + OpenAI**, this tool bridges the gap between **strategic product planning** and **structured process execution**.

---

## Why I Built This 

As a Product Manager, I often noticed this disconnect:

- Roadmaps lived in docs, Notion, or whiteboards.
- Engineers wanted structured flows.
- Ops needed standardized process logic.
- Everyone wanted *clarity* fast.

So I built a tool to solve that:

>  From high-level roadmap ‚Üí to BPMN diagram ‚Üí to executable workflows ‚Äî in seconds.

This project showcases how I:
- Identify real-world friction between teams
- Translate ambiguous inputs into structured, actionable formats
- Use AI practically (not just as a buzzword)
- Work cross-functionally across design, dev, and ops layers

## üîç What It Does

- Upload a CSV or type a roadmap
- Uses **Mistral via Ollama** (self-hosted LLM) 
- Auto-convert each step into BPMN 2.0 XML using OpenAI
- Visualize using `bpmn-js` viewer
- Export valid BPMN diagrams ready for workflow engines (Camunda, Zeebe, etc.)

---

## Demo

Here‚Äôs how the tool works in action:
Upload a roadmap CSV ‚Äî for example:
1. Idea Review  
2. Design Kickoff  
3. Development  
4. QA Testing  
5. Launch  

- The AI maps each step into a structured BPMN flow
- Output is visualized instantly as a BPMN diagram using bpmn-js
- You can export the BPMN XML and plug it into engines like Camunda or Zeebe
