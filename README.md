#  AI Roadmap → BPMN Workflow Converter

Convert product or project roadmaps into clean, visual **BPMN workflows** using AI.  
Built with **Java + React + OpenAI**, this tool bridges the gap between **strategic product planning** and **structured process execution**.

---

## Why I Built This 

As a Product Manager, I often noticed this disconnect:

- Roadmaps lived in docs, Notion, or whiteboards.
- Engineers wanted structured flows.
- Ops needed standardized process logic.
- Everyone wanted *clarity* fast.

So I built a tool to solve that:

>  From high-level roadmap → to BPMN diagram → to executable workflows — in seconds.

This project showcases how I:
- Identify real-world friction between teams
- Translate ambiguous inputs into structured, actionable formats
- Use AI practically (not just as a buzzword)
- Work cross-functionally across design, dev, and ops layers

## 🔍 What It Does

- Upload a CSV or type a roadmap
- Uses **Mistral via Ollama** (self-hosted LLM) 
- Auto-convert each step into BPMN 2.0 XML using OpenAI
- Visualize using `bpmn-js` viewer
- Export valid BPMN diagrams ready for workflow engines (Camunda, Zeebe, etc.)

## Demo

> Example input:
  1.	User Sign-up: Register with email
	2.	Email Verification: Confirm via link
	3.	Profile Completion: Add basic info
	4.	Dashboard: Personalized view

➡️ Output: A BPMN diagram  
`Start → Task 1 → Task 2 → ... → End`
